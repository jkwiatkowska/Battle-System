# Customisable Battle System
This Unity project focuses on the implementation of an RPG-style battle system customisable through a dedicated tool. The system is component based and offers endless possibilities through a large range of options for customising skills, status effects and triggers that interact together. 
The tool is not quite ready for use (needs documentation, more testing and a better interface), but it is usable and was succesfully used to recreate a variety of complex skills and mechanics from existing games.
